			Welcome to the podcast Medabrim Schlichut (literally - Talking Mission) - the only podcast that gives a stage to Israeli Schlichim.<br>
			We interview past and present Schlichim who share their experiences with us.<br>
			A lot of their experiences are mutual, though many are unique.<br>
			Wether you consider going on a Schlichut, are on a Schlichut or were on a Schlichut - you will find here inspiration, important insights and useful tips through the Schlichim's stories.<br>
			Everywhere you are, in Israel or abroad, on foot or in your car - you are invited to listen to the podcast that talks with the Schlichim eye to eye
